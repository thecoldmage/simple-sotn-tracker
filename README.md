Hello,

This is a simple Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Randomizer relic and item tracker. 
The intention for this application is to provide a tracker/checklist in single HTML file that can be viewed in a web browser without any external resources.
This item tracker is mostly designed for casual players in mind, but has functionality for knowledgable players and streamers as well. 
The Auto Tracker used by the community is limited for use with the BizHawk Emulator and involves installing files and a bit of setup. 
This tracker isn't meant to compete with or replace the Auto Tracker, but merely offer an alternative for new players, casual players, or folks playing on a different emulator or physical hardware.
There is built-in functionality to save/load seed progress by generating a query string that appends to the URL of the web page which can be saved, bookmarked, or recalled in your browser history.
The icon images are all encoded in base64 format; no additonal assets or downloads required to make this tracker work.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy it.
